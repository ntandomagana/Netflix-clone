          <button class="accordion-question">Is Netflix good for kids?</button>

          <p class="accordion-answer">
            The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to give
            parents control while kids enjoy family-friendly TV shows and movies
            in their own space.

            <br />

            Kids profiles come with PIN-protected parental controls that let you
            restrict the maturity rating of content kids can watch and block
            specific titles you don’t want kids to see.
